Verify installation
Login to Knova (http://pww.eureka.aai.ms.philips.com/KanisaSupportCenter/loginSubmit.do)
Find a document that you can edit and open the document editor.
You should see a button “Set Fields for archiving” on the top of the page. 
Click the button; it will clear the fields and pop up a preview window of your changes. Your changes are automatically saved as a draft.
For people working on the HISS document list, you will see another button “Next document” on the top of the page. Click this to quickly go to the next document.
 To quickly go to a document when you have the external ID – type in the following URL (in this example, I’ve used 27163, change it to your document’s ID)
http://pww.eureka.aai.ms.philips.com/KanisaSupportCenter/authoring/editDocument.do?externalID=27163
Lastly, go back to Knova homepage and check that your authoring inbox has the documents that you just edited..
Congrats, the plug in is working
